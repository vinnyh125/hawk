# hawk
So I was at the bar one day and two hawks came in.

The first hawk (hawk 1) asked the second hawk (hawk 2) a question. 

The conversation went along the lines of:

Hawk 1: [to hawk 2] do you know the line integral of the subset of null spaces presented by the sigma function provided by the system calls made by process 1?

Hawk 2: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Me: wait, say that again....
